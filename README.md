SCRUM- Scrum is an agile framework used for managing and completing complex projects. It focuses on iterative progress, collaboration, and flexibility, making it popular for software development but applicable to a wide range of projects.
SPRINT-A Sprint is a fundamental element of the Scrum framework, which is an iterative cycle in which work is completed incrementally. It is a time-boxed period, typically lasting between one and four weeks, during which a specific set of work must be completed and made ready for review.
BACKLOG-The Sprint Backlog is a set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, along with a plan for delivering the product increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. 
Components:
1)Selected Product Backlog Items: High-priority items chosen for the Sprint.
2)Task Breakdown: Detailed tasks needed to complete the selected items.
3)Sprint Goal: A concise summary of what the team aims to achieve during the Sprint.
EPIC-Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks known as User Stories. Epics are used to capture big pieces of functionality and provide a high-level perspective of the overall project.
BURNDOWN CHART-A burndown chart displays the amount of work remaining versus the time left in a project or Sprint. It helps teams visualize their progress and predict whether they will complete the work by the end of the time frame.
